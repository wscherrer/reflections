What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

> a file that contains the initial record of the directory is created. This needs to
be done so git can track changes to the files when commits / changes are made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

> The staging area has access to a collection of files that doesn't belong to git 
(working directory) and a collection of files that does belong to git (staging) and
which will become part of the repository. It allows one to see what has been added
and what has been excluded.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

> Add only the file(s) per each logical change to the staging area and commit
before addressing the next logical change (?)

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

>Branches would be helpful in creating additional versions, add and test new features
before making new versions, experiment...

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

> Diagrams make keeping track of the graph and what changes were made easier. A text
representation of this is not manageable, especially within limited amount of screen
space.
