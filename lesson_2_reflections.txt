What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

> a file that contains the initial record of the directory is created. This needs to
be done so git can track changes to the files when commits / changes are made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

> The staging area has access to a collection of files that doesn't belong to git 
(working directory) and a collection of files that does belong to git (staging) and
which will become part of the repository. It allows one to see what has been added
and what has been excluded.
