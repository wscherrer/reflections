When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

> When a group of people are needed for a project. Sharing a remote repository both allows
individuals to work independently and enables the group to coordinate their efforts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

> Allowing Git to stay up to date would make it difficult to make smaller changes when
these might have been necessary. Pulling manually breaks the work up into smaller,
more manageable pieces.
